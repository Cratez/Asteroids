# Droids
This is intended to be a game where you can fly around space and shoot stuff.

I intended to learn sfml and box2d from this, and want specifically to make sure I had a firm understanding of sfml's views and how to draw huds and whatnot in sfml.

I also really enjoyed writing a starfield class. That was too much fun.
